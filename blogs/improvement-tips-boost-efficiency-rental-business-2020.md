# 6 Improvement tips to boost the efficiency of your rental business in 2020

Improving the efficiency of a rental company is not different from any other, but the priorities may be slightly different. It is important to improve your internal processes so that your customers are well served and that you focus more on your business development. When your customers are pleased, that's when they're going to spread the world to your advantage, which is the most efficient and productive marketing tool.

There are a lot of ways to improve the productivity of your rental operations, but here we have chosen the best approaches we've seen that have worked and helped our customers, and in this article we would be happy to share with you. 


## Digitize
Many different industries are already in the process of digitization around the world, but often we feel that the rental industry is a little behind when it comes to digitization. As I write this article, some of our consultants are working with our clients to understand their rental business process in order to digitize them and keep the transformation as seamlessly as possible.

We have written an in-depth article on the importance of digitization over [here](https://renetal.com/blog/the-importance-of-digitization-in-rental-business).

## Automate
Quite often we are incredibly busy running our rental business on a regular basis and end up doing a lot of routine work without even knowing that this particular piece of work can be automated and can be done without any human interference and without negligence.

Here are a couple of examples of automation benefits:

- Each morning, give me a list of pickups, returns, and a report that has been overdue.
- Twice a day, automatically send a list of tasks to the crew and help them track it.
- Give me weekly and monthly comprehensive reports on the overall output of my business for a whole week or month.
- Acknowledge well in advance of the machinery that will have an upcoming repair.
 
## Improve Operations Process
Rental business operations can be daunting tasks if you have a lot of inventory assets to handle and a lot of orders that keep the employees busy and put customer service at risk on some occasions.

To streamline and gain control of your rental business, it is essential to implement the "**[most trusted rental software](https://renetal.com)**" that would prevent users from making foolish mistakes and help you take control of your operations, which would also lead to overall improvement. As a bonus, you and your team will have more time to spend learning more about your customers and using the data to make strategic decisions that will help the business grow.

## Timely Maintenance
You don't want to rent out faulty equipment, or the worst case will be that your client has taken the equipment on a long term rental, and the fix is due early. How are you going to handle this situation by keeping costs low?

Equipment servicing is another task that needs to be handled effectively as it adds to the profit and loss statement, and your accountant may be very curious to know the specifics of the equipment-level cost, weekly and monthly.

## Daily Tasks
Keeping track of the internal tasks that should be completed just before the pick-up date can be a challenging task during the peak season. Some inventory assets require a special set of checks before or after they are returned from the customer. Or, in some instances, the customer may have a very special requirement that you need to meet before you pick up.

The rental management software should have the built-in ability to create and assign tasks to the customer's rental order and assign them to the respective crew - so they can be easily tracked and managed.

## Track Rental Orders
If the rental operation is a manual where you need to track orders on excel sheets, whiteboards, labeling system or even maintain bill books-these approaches could be resource hungry which may be more error prone to double booking or overbooking on certain occasions.

But there is also a smarter way to do this by tracking orders in a sophisticated rental management software that can help you track orders by automating most of the hard work with the least effort possible.
