# Improvement tips to boost the efficiency of your rental business in 2020

Improving the efficiency of a rental company is not different from any other, but the priorities may be slightly different. It is important to improve your internal processes so that your customers are well served and that you focus more on your business development. When your customers are pleased, that's when they're going to spread the world to your advantage, which is the most efficient and productive marketing tool.

However, there are a number of ways to improve the productivity of your rental operations. But in this article, we are pleased to share with you the ***best-chosen approaches*** that have worked in the rental industry.


## Digitize
Many different industries are already in the process of digitization around the world, but often we feel that the rental industry is a little behind when it comes to digitization. As I write this article, some of our consultants are working with our clients to understand their rental business process in order to digitize them and keep the transformation as seamlessly as possible.

Once your operations have been digitized, the benefits can be quite obvious and seen very often, such as:

- Reduction of costs
- Reduces and eliminates redundancy in your paperwork.
- Minimizes human error
- Helps you to work with others, etc.

We have written an in-depth article on the ***importance of digitization*** over [here](https://renetal.com/blog/the-importance-of-digitization-in-rental-business).

## Automate
Quite often we are incredibly busy running our rental business on a regular basis and end up doing a lot of routine work without even realizing that this particular piece of work can be automated and can be done without any human interference and without negligence.

If you are able to identify repetitive and time-consuming tasks and then start automating them in an organized step-by-step approach, these are the ***automation benefits*** you would be rewarded with:

- Each morning, give me a list of pickups, returns, and a report that has been overdue.
- Twice a day, automatically send a list of tasks to the crew and help them track it.
- Give me weekly and monthly comprehensive reports on the overall output of my business for a whole week or month.
- Acknowledge well in advance of the machinery that will have an upcoming repair.
 
## Improve Operations Process

Some of the business operations in rentals can be daunting tasks if you have a lot of inventory assets to handle and a lot of orders that keep employees busy and put customer service at risk on a number of occasions. In the past, we've met many rental merchants who are guilty of not spending enough time to understand their customers when they visit in-store rentals and fail to understand their rental needs.

Understanding the needs of a customer is extremely important for any business in general, so it is not different for your rental business. Either you or your staff would like to maintain a personal contact with your customers so that their specific requirements are well understood and can be met.

In order to streamline and gain control of your rental business, it is essential to implement the "**[most trusted rental software](https://renetal.com)**" that would prevent users from making foolish mistakes and help you take control of your operations, which would also lead to overall improvement. As a bonus, you and your team will have more time to spend learning more about your customers and using the data to make strategic decisions that will help the business grow.

## Relevant Inventory
Keeping the irrelevant inventory in-store and sorting through it to meet the needs of the customer can be time-consuming tasks for your staff, which contributes to increasing the waiting time for the customer-in some cases, which has led to a bit of frustration, which is bad customer experience.

It is vital for any rental business owner to know their inventory assets well enough to identify them with their types or groups that are in demand, slow-moving or poorly performing as well. It's not an easy task to know your data insights manually, because it requires a very special analytical skills for anyone to traverse the data that you can rely on to make some smart business decisions. Often, this problem is solved by using the rental management software, which should provide you with the required analytical reports and charts in something that you obviously rely on.

## Timely Maintenance

Any rental business would not want to rent out faulty equipment, or the worst case will be that your client has taken the equipment on a long term rental, and the fix is due early. How are you going to handle this situation by keeping costs low?

Equipment service is another task that needs to be dealt with effectively, as it adds to the profit and loss statement, and your accountant may be very curious to know the specifics of the equipment â€“ cost levels, weekly and monthly. The staff should always have a list of the equipment that is due for maintenance, and the software that you are using to handle business operations should alert users if any of the maintenance dates fall between the rental period.

## Daily Tasks
Keeping track of the internal tasks that should be completed just before the pick-up date can be easily missed due to the high volume of orders during the peak season. Some inventory assets require a special set of checks before or after being returned from the customer. Or, in some cases , the customer may have a very special requirement that you need to comply with before you pick up the rental order.

The rental management software should have the built-in ability to create and assign tasks to the customer's rental order and assign them to the respective crew - so they can be easily tracked and managed.

## Track Rental Orders
If the rental operation is a manual where you need to track orders on excel sheets, whiteboards, labeling system or even maintain bill books-these approaches could be resource hungry which may be more error prone to double booking or overbooking on certain occasions.

But there is also a smarter way to do this by tracking orders in a sophisticated rental management software that can help you track orders by automating most of the hard work with the least effort possible.
